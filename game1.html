    <h2>Game Manual: </h2>
    <h3>Game Overview: </h3>
    <p>City Development is a collaborative game where multiple players work together to develop a city. 
    </p>
    <h3>Game Objectives: </h3>
    <p>The objectives of the game are to increase the city's population and maintain a stable city base score. Players need to coordinate and collaborate with various departments to develop the city, respond to emergencies, and keep the city in a healthy and sustainable state of development. 
    </p>
    <h3>Game Rules: </h3> 
    <ul>
        <li> The city starts with a base score of 100 and a population of 50,000. The initial city wealth is 1 million. 
        </li>
        <li>The city is composed of eight systems. Each round, three systems are chosen for discussion and upgrade. 
        </li>
        <li> If there is insufficient city infrastructure to serve the population, the city's score will be deducted by 10, and the population will decrease by 50,000 for that round. 
        </li>
        <li>In addition to the given development opportunities, players can use their city wealth once per round to develop a specific system. Developing a school requires 2 million, developing the city itself requires 4 million, and developing other systems requires 1 million. 
        </li>
        <li> The game consists of 25 rounds, or the game ends if the city score reaches 0. 
        </li>
        <li>Starting from the fifth round, a sudden event will occur every two rounds. If the city cannot cope with the event, the city score will be deducted by 10. If the event is successfully resolved, the score will be increased by 10. 
        </li>
        <li> If the event cannot be resolved successfully, players can choose whether to inform the public. If they choose to inform, the city population will decrease by 50,000, but the city score will be restored by 5. 
        </li>
        <li>The game ends with a final score based on the city's population, city score, and city wealth. Every additional 10,000 city residents or 1 million cumulative city wealth earns 1 point. 
        </li>
    </ul>
