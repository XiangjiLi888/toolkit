        <h1>Building an Effective Team</h1>
        <p> <a href="EffectiveTeam.html">Building an Effective Team: </a>is a management game that tests how players coordinate the cooperation of various employees, thereby helping players improve their ability to form an efficient company team. A company usually contains at least five categories of people, including managers, technical developers, salespeople, publicists, and production personnel. Players take on the role of the founder of a company, striving to improve the company's market performance and economic returns by recruiting, managing, and optimizing team members, balancing the company's expenses with product revenue each round, and responding to changes in the external environment. With limited resources, players need to develop strategies and decisions to achieve the goals set by the game in the set round.
